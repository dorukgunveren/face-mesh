# face-mesh
Real-time face mesh using MediaPipe and OpenCV with FPS display

This project uses MediaPipe's Face Mesh model alongside OpenCV to detect and visualize facial landmarks in real-time from a webcam stream. It identifies human faces in each video frame, extracts facial landmark coordinates, and draws a detailed face mesh on the detected faces. The frame rate (FPS) is also displayed on the output window.
